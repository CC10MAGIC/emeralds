Emeralds Mod

This mod adds emerald ore and some decorative blocks to minetest. It has been made by cloning the textures and the code of the quartz mod and modifying them. Credit for the original code and textures goes to the author of the quartz mod. I changed the code and names to emerald and I redesigned the textures to look like emerald. Emeralds are twice as rare as quartz but that's not much. Maybe I will add emerald weapons and emerald tools in the future.
